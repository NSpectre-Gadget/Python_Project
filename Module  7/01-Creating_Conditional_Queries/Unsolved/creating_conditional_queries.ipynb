    "# Creating Conditional Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you’ll create SQL queries that each return a set of data based on the conditions that you specify. You’ll use the SQL `WHERE` clause to check the conditions and return the records that you want from your database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the required libraries and dependencies: Pandas, Path, and SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Read stock_data.csv` into a new Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > **Important** For this activity, you don’t need to set the “date” column as a `DatetimeIndex`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Set up a database connection by completing the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Create the connection string for your new SQLite database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Pass the connection string to the `create_engine` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Confirm the creation of the database engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use the `to_sql` function to create a new table named `stock_prices` in the database. To do so, use the information in the `stock_prices_df` DataFrame. Be sure to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Include the parameters for the engine, the index, and replace the table if it already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Call the `table_names` function to confirm that the newly created table exists in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a SQL query to return the \"date\" and “TSLA” columns, where the “TSLA” value is less than 400. To run the query, call the `execute` function on the database engine. Review the list of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Write a SQL query to return the \"date\" and “TSLA” columns, where the TSLA value is greater than 400. To run the query, call the `execute` function on the database engine. Review the list of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Write a SQL query to return the “date”, “AAPL”, and “TSLA” columns, where the “date” column equals 2019-08-07. To run the query, call the `execute` function on the database engine. Review the list of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    > **Hint** In the `stock_prices` table, the “date” column stores its data as strings and not as numerical values. To access this data via a SQL query, you need to place it in quotation marks&mdash;for example, “2019-08-07”.\n",
